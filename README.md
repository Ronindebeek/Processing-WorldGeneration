# Processing-WorldGeneration
Procedural World Generation using Processing and Java

Personal project capable of generating continents with a height, temperature, rainfall and biomes. 

Initially pure Processing was used (till version 4), however with version 5, to increase flexibility by using Java and not having to use the Processing IDE, the switch was made to a Java project using Processing as a library.

## Setup
### Libraries
Version 5 needs 2 external libraries that have to be imported manually:
- **core.jar** The Processing library
- **controlP5.jar** The GUI library used together with Processing

These libraries can be obtained by downloading the latest Processing and installing the controlP5 plugin via the Processing IDE at the following paths respectively (assuming default install locations):
- \Program Files\processing-3.5.3\core\library\core.jar
- \User\\%userprofile%\Documents\Processing\libraries\controlP5\library\controlP5.jar
