# Processing-WorldGeneration
Procedural World Generation using Processing and Java

Personal project capable of generating continents with a height, temperature, rainfall and biomes. 
Initially pure Processing was used (till version 4), however with version 4.1 to increase flexibility by using core java and not having to use the Processing IDE the switch was made to a java project using Processing as a library.
